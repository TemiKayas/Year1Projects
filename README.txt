This is a script I wrote to automate opening multiple instances of Minecraft, anywhere from 1-40. Then logging each instance into its own account, then connecting them 
to their respective proxies. Following this, it would then start another script to start farming. Please input your account details and proxy IPS where the comments 
indicate. Please also indicate how many sugar cane accounts you are using, along with how many nether wart accounts you are using.
